# GDSC-WT2023
#Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCS) is something VITians has to go through to choose their subjects and faculties every semester. But preparing for FFCS is a time taking process and needs research to end up with a good time table. VITians know that doing this can sometimes be a real agony. Therefore we are coming up with a system that can sail you through the process at ease and guide you at every step of the process. In pre phase of FFCS our system helps you to design a timetable according to your priorities on slots, faculties, and venue. Some features of BFF-CS will be:

#Choosing of an organised time table.
#Can avoid certain slots for your convinence
#Make a priority list of faculties/subjects and design time table accordingly
#You can visualize your slots with respect to time and credits
#Avoid clashing of slots by a warning message
#Also get a warning if your adjacent class venues are far apart
#Get alerted if the pre-requisites of a particular course is not met
#Choosing preffered location in a building
#We plan on implementing this system using Python and its libraries along with PyQT5 as our front-end user interface and JSON as back-end database. We may also use built-in Python modules to help us implement the backend algorithms. For more details please do refer the pdf presentation which is attached along with this idea.

#Our ulitimate goal is to make every VITian to have hassle free FFCS and end up with an organised and satisfactory time table.
